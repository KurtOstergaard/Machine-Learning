### My work in the Coursera Machine Learning Class

I decided to post my work to github after finishing the class to show the kind of problems addressed in the class and the type of analyses I am capable of performing. 

I didn't post this to github previously because I the thought did not cross my mind earlier.

Andrew Ng created a wonderful class and is an incredible teacher. I have immense respect for the man. I recommend this course to anyone with interest in Machine Learning.
